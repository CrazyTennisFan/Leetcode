Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

For example,
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
s = "rat", t = "car", return false.

Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Complexity analysis

Time complexity : O(n)O(n). Time complexity is O(n)O(n) because accessing the counter table is a constant time operation.

Space complexity : O(1)O(1). Although we do use extra space, the space complexity is O(1)O(1) because the table's size stays constant no matter how large nn is.

Answer

Use a hash table instead of a fixed size counter. Imagine allocating a large size array to fit the entire range of unicode characters, which could go up to more than 1 million. A hash table is a more generic solution and could adapt to any range of characters.
